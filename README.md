## General info

We started by loading the appropriate libraries needed for the project and analyed the ‘iris’ dataset. 
The famous ‘iris’ dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Refer to [report](https://github.com/pranshu1921/Clustering-Decision-Tree-Iris-data/blob/master/Report.docx) attached for complete information.

## Setup

* Download the .R file.

* Run the .R file using R Studio(recommended).

## Status
Project status: **Finished**
